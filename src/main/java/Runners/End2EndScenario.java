                        I am using extend report in my current project.
                              In this report I have a chart it is showing me how many features
                                how many scenarios and steps I ran in that runner.

                         If I have a fails then it is showing as red so it is understandable for every one in the team
                           After I run my regression or smoke I share with the team and they also aware of the result.
