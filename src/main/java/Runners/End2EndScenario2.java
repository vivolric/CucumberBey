                What kind of report do you use in your project?
                        I am using extend report in my current project.
                              In this report I have a chart it is showing me how many features
                                how many scenarios and steps I ran in that runner.

                         If I have a fails then it is showing as red so it is understandable for every one in the team
                           After I run my regression or smoke I share with the team and they also aware of the result.

                If they asked
                        What is the Runner files what can we say?
                        How do you run your multiple feature files together?
                        For example you have 20 scenarios and you would like to run 15 of them how you can do it?

                 Runner is helps me to run multiple feature files or scenarious together.
                        I can decide with a tags which file or which scenario to run.

                        For example in my project I have regressionRunner class and I have a regression tag.
                        I am adding these tags to feature files and according to tags runner will run those scenarios.
